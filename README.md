# WALTER: web-based toolset for terminal restriction fragments (TRF) scan analysis, version of May 2020
WALTER is a web-based toolset for terminal restriction fragments (TRF) scan analysis. It is consisted of two tools: ScanToIntensity and IntensityAnalyser. ScanToIntensity tool is able to convert selected areas of TRF scan into intensity profiles (approximately a matter of seconds up to a half-minute per sample based on the resolution of TRF scan and selected range) while IntensityAnalyser tool analyses the resultant file from ScanToIntensity (in a matter of seconds) to provide a boxplot or a violin plot depiction of said profiles with a possible statistical analysis (available at: https://www.ceitec.eu/chromatin-molecular-complexes-jiri-fajkus/rg51/tab?tabId=125#WALTER).
