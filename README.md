# WALTER: web-based toolset for terminal restriction fragments (TRF) scan analysis, version 2.0 (release December 2020)
WALTER is a web-based toolset for terminal restriction fragments (TRF) scan analysis. It is consisted of two tools: ScanToIntensity and IntensityAnalyser. ScanToIntensity tool is able to convert selected areas of TRF scan into intensity profiles (approximately seconds up to half of a minute per sample based on the resolution of TRF scan and selected range) while IntensityAnalyser tool analyses the resultant file from ScanToIntensity (approximately milliseconds up to second per sample) to provide a boxplot or a violin plot depiction of said profiles with a possible statistical analysis (available at: https://www.ceitec.eu/chromatin-molecular-complexes-jiri-fajkus/rg51/tab?tabId=125#WALTER).
